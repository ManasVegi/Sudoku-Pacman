# Sudoku-Pacman
CSP for Sudoku and Reinforcement Learning for Pacman
#Overview
##Project 2 is divided into 2 parts:
###Solving Sudoku Puzzles as Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs)
Your task is to implement the backtracking search algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles
as CSPs.
###Solving the Pacman Game via Reinforcement Learning
In this project , you will implement a Q-learning agent as well as an approximate Qlearning
agent and train them to play the game of Pacman1. This project includes an
autograder for the first two subtasks.
